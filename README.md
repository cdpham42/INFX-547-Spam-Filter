Spam filter created for an assignment in INFX 574 Data Science II: Machine Learning and Econometrics. Students were to create a spam filter using at least two different machine learning techniques. We used Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression for the classification task; Naive Bayes for a Bayesian model and its simplicity, high performance, and popularity as a baseline; Random Forests for being a decision tree and thus a different method of classification, and logistic regression for being simpler than random forests, a linear model, with low variance.

Overall results are a 95.12% accuracy for Naive Bayes, 78.65% accuracy for Random Forests, and 90.85% accuracy for Logistic Regression.
